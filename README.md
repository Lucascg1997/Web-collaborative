Each of us works on a different file, for a different part of the website and the most senior can work as Team Leader (for integration and deployment). The Html-Template-Engine library will take care of putting all the pieces together. The Html-Template-Engine library is being used as template engine for building the landing page.

Instructions:
- The Team Leader should fork this repository on github.com and invite other collaborators to the repo.
- We are going to be building this design, and this is how you can split with the students
- Each contributor will have to clone the new forked repository and develop one piece of the website you have chosee, each project is divided in pieces inside its templates/ directory.
- REMEMBER: When each team member finishes, they have to commit and push to the forked repository
